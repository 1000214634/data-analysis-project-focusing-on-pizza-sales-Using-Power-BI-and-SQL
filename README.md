data analysis project focusing on pizza sales! üçï Using Power BI and SQL, I've developed a comprehensive dashboard that provides insightful analytics into sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue performance. By leveraging data-driven insights, we've optimized marketing strategies, identified top-performing products, and enhanced operational efficiencies for our pizza business.

Key highlights of this project:

Utilized SQL queries to extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources including sales transactions, customer profiles, and product inventory.

Designed interactive Power BI dashboards with dynamic visualizations such as sales trends over time, geographical sales distribution and product performance metrics
